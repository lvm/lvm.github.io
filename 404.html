The RF2616 defines the [*cliente* error 404](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.5) as follows:  


    The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No
    indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or
    permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server
    knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old
    resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address.
    This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to
    reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other
    response is applicable.


In other words, the server decided that the content you're looking for is confidential.
