I've been watching several people drawing random figures with only CSS and letters, [Román Cortés](http://www.romancortes.com/) in particular, who made Homer Simpson, an Origami Crane (bird), a "3D" can of Coke among other stuff.  
The other day I was bored and with some free time so I "drew" the Debian logo :-)  
![Debian CSS](http://i.imgur.com/1dBBy.png)  
The logo above is a screenshot of how it looks using epiphany-webkit (2.29.3-1) which, btw, works better on every update. On the other hand, on Iceweasel (3.5.8-1) doesn't look that good but it looks good enough.  
  
Well, if you want to see how it looks on your browser click [here](http://cacavoladora.org/e/xperiments/d/ebian/swirl.html). Also, if you think you can improve the looks, leave me a comment or contact me and I'll update it.
