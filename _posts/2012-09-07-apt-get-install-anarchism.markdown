After almost two years [0] [1] (I missed it by 23 days) I've uploaded a new release (released on 2010, meh) of [An Anarchist FAQ](http://packages.debian.org/anarchism). But that's not all: Also, from now on there's a [git repository](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/anarchism.git;a=summary) of the Debian package.  
Hopefully, with this cleaned up version and the git repo, anybody who wishes to collaborate on this very simple yet interesting package can do so.
