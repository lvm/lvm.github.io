Among other random-stuff, I have this mental-TODO list for quite some time, just in case we dissapear (probably it'll be just like in Y2K):  
  
[ ] Form a Death-freaking-uber-grind-metal band and tour all over the world.  
[ ] Travel to Japan  
[ ] See Faith No More live  
[X] See [Racing Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Club_de_Avellaneda) win a championship.  
[X] Shoot a cultish bizarre short-film about the (almighty) Cthulhu  
[X] Make a living with free software  
[X] See Opeth live  
[X] Become a Debian Developer o/  
  
So I'd like to thank to those who helped me during and before the process (advocating, sponsoring, am-ing, etc).  
  
/me waves to the crowd, grabs his oscar-award and leaves the scenario.
